        <p>The National Catering Exhibition Centre. This site is live, but it is still an ongoing project. There's a lot of features and pages left to be added. I designed and developed this site while at Nisbets.</p>

        <h2>Yugen Clothing</h2>
        <p>Yugen Clothing is a side business of mine that specialises in selling organic and ethical clothing. The site is built on Wordpress. Designed and developed by myself, it's a fully functional e-commerce website.</p>

        <h2>Buffalo Appliances</h2>
        <p>Buffalo is a very well-known, international catering appliances brand. The site is built on Magento. I designed and developed the site on the front end. I'm really proud of the carousel, it took a lot of tweaking.</p>

        <h2>Euro Sweepstakes Project</h2>
        <p>This is an old project of mine, which essentially uses a Google Sheet (spreadsheet) as a back end, using an API, tabletop.js. Some of the code is horrible, but it was a 24 hour project, although now I would tell myself that there's no excuse. One day I will revisit it and refactor the code.</p>

        <h2>Home Chef</h2>
        <p>Home Chef is the domestic arm of the Nisbets website, which I designed and front end developed. The site had to built into the Nisbets site, so I had to come up with a way for users to be eased onto the different site without it being too jarring. That's when I made a redirect modal to help this process. </p>
